    "34": "And [mention] when We said to the angels, \"Prostrate before Adam\"; so they prostrated, except for Iblees. He refused and was arrogant and became of the disbelievers.",

    "50": "And [recall] when We parted the sea for you and saved you and drowned the people of Pharaoh while you were looking on.",
    "51": "And [recall] when We made an appointment with Moses for forty nights. Then you took [for worship] the calf after him [i.e., his departure], while you were wrongdoers.",
    "52": "Then We forgave you after that so perhaps you would be grateful.",
    "53": "And [recall] when We gave Moses the Scripture and criterion that perhaps you would be guided.",
    "54": "And [recall] when Moses said to his people, \"O my people, indeed you have wronged yourselves by your taking of the calf [for worship]. So repent to your Creator and kill yourselves [i.e., the guilty among you]. That is best for [all of] you in the sight of your Creator.\" Then He accepted your repentance; indeed, He is the Accepting of Repentance, the Merciful.",
    "55": "And [recall] when you said, \"O Moses, we will never believe you until we see All\u0101h outright\"; so the thunderbolt took you while you were looking on.",
    "56": "Then We revived you after your death that perhaps you would be grateful.",
    "57": "And We shaded you with clouds and sent down to you manna and quails, [saying], \"Eat from the good things with which We have provided you.\" And they wronged Us not - but they were [only] wronging themselves.",
    "58": "And [recall] when We said, \"Enter this city [i.e., Jerusalem] and eat from it wherever you will in [ease and] abundance, and enter the gate bowing humbly and say, 'Relieve us of our burdens [i.e., sins].' We will [then] forgive your sins for you, and We will increase the doers of good [in goodness and reward].\"",
    "59": "But those who wronged changed [those words] to a statement other than that which had been said to them, so We sent down upon those who wronged a punishment [i.e., plague] from the sky because they were defiantly disobeying.",
    "60": "And [recall] when Moses prayed for water for his people, so We said, \"Strike with your staff the stone.\" And there gushed forth from it twelve springs, and every people [i.e., tribe] knew its watering place. \"Eat and drink from the provision of All\u0101h, and do not commit abuse on the earth, spreading corruption.\"",
    "61": "And [recall] when you said, \"O Moses, we can never endure one [kind of] food. So call upon your Lord to bring forth for us from the earth its green herbs and its cucumbers and its garlic and its lentils and its onions.\" [Moses] said, \"Would you exchange what is better for what is less? Go into [any] settlement and indeed, you will have what you have asked.\" And they were covered with humiliation and poverty and returned with anger from All\u0101h [upon them]. That was because they [repeatedly] disbelieved in the signs of All\u0101h and killed the prophets without right. That was because they disobeyed and were [habitually] transgressing.",
    "62": "Indeed, those who believed and those who were Jews or Christians or Sabeans [before Prophet Mu\u1e25ammad (\ufdfa)] - those [among them] who believed in All\u0101h and the Last Day and did righteousness - will have their reward with their Lord, and no fear will there be concerning them, nor will they grieve.",
    "63": "And [recall] when We took your covenant, [O Children of Israel, to abide by the Torah] and We raised over you the mount, [saying], \"Take what We have given you with determination and remember what is in it that perhaps you may become righteous.\"",
    "64": "Then you turned away after that. And if not for the favor of All\u0101h upon you and His mercy, you would have been among the losers.",
    "65": "And you had already known about those who transgressed among you concerning the sabbath, and We said to them, \"Be apes, despised.\"",
    "66": "And We made it a deterrent punishment for those who were present and those who succeeded [them] and a lesson for those who fear All\u0101h.",
    "67": "And [recall] when Moses said to his people, \"Indeed, All\u0101h commands you to slaughter a cow.\" They said, \"Do you take us in ridicule?\" He said, \"I seek refuge in All\u0101h from being among the ignorant.\"",
    "68": "They said, \"Call upon your Lord to make clear to us what it is.\" [Moses] said, \"[All\u0101h] says, 'It is a cow which is neither old nor virgin, but median between that,' so do what you are commanded.\"",
    "69": "They said, \"Call upon your Lord to show us what is her color.\" He said, \"He says, 'It is a yellow cow, bright in color - pleasing to the observers.'\"",
    "70": "They said, \"Call upon your Lord to make clear to us what it is. Indeed, [all] cows look alike to us. And indeed we, if All\u0101h wills, will be guided.\"",
    "71": "He said, \"He says, 'It is a cow neither trained to plow the earth nor to irrigate the field, one free from fault with no spot upon her.'\" They said, \"Now you have come with the truth.\" So they slaughtered her, but they could hardly do it.",
    "72": "And [recall] when you slew a man and disputed over it, but All\u0101h was to bring out that which you were concealing.",
    "73": "So We said, \"Strike him [i.e., the slain man] with part of it.\" Thus does All\u0101h bring the dead to life, and He shows you His signs that you might reason.",
    "74": "Then your hearts became hardened after that, being like stones or even harder. For indeed, there are stones from which rivers burst forth, and there are some of them that split open and water comes out, and there are some of them that fall down for fear of All\u0101h. And All\u0101h is not unaware of what you do.",
    "75": "Do you covet [the hope, O believers], that they would believe for you while a party of them used to hear the words of All\u0101h and then distort it [i.e., the Torah] after they had understood it while they were knowing?",
    "76": "And when they meet those who believe, they say, \"We have believed\"; but when they are alone with one another, they say, \"Do you talk to them about what All\u0101h has revealed to you so they can argue with you about it before your Lord?\" Then will you not reason?",
    "77": "But do they not know that All\u0101h knows what they conceal and what they declare?",
    "78": "And among them are unlettered ones who do not know the Scripture except [indulgement in] wishful thinking, but they are only assuming.",
    "79": "So woe to those who write the \"scripture\" with their own hands, then say, \"This is from All\u0101h,\" in order to exchange it for a small price. Woe to them for what their hands have written and woe to them for what they earn.",
    "80": "And they say, \"Never will the Fire touch us, except for [a few] numbered days.\" Say, \"Have you taken a covenant with All\u0101h? For All\u0101h will never break His covenant. Or do you say about All\u0101h that which you do not know?\"",
    "81": "Yes, [on the contrary], whoever earns evil and his sin has encompassed him - those are the companions of the Fire; they will abide therein eternally.",
    "82": "But they who believe and do righteous deeds - those are the companions of Paradise; they will abide therein eternally.",
    "83": "And [recall] when We took the covenant from the Children of Israel, [enjoining upon them], \"Do not worship except All\u0101h; and to parents do good and to relatives, orphans, and the needy. And speak to people good [words] and establish prayer and give zak\u0101h.\" Then you turned away, except a few of you, and you were refusing.",
    "84": "And [recall] when We took your covenant, [saying], \"Do not shed your [i.e., each other's] blood or evict one another from your homes.\" Then you acknowledged [this] while you were witnessing.",
    "85": "Then, you are those [same ones who are] killing one another and evicting a party of your people from their homes, cooperating against them in sin and aggression. And if they come to you as captives, you ransom them, although their eviction was forbidden to you. So do you believe in part of the Scripture and disbelieve in part? Then what is the recompense for those who do that among you except disgrace in worldly life; and on the Day of Resurrection they will be sent back to the severest of punishment. And All\u0101h is not unaware of what you do.",
    "86": "Those are the ones who have bought the life of this world [in exchange] for the Hereafter, so the punishment will not be lightened for them, nor will they be aided.",
    "87": "And We did certainly give Moses the Scripture [i.e., the Torah] and followed up after him with messengers. And We gave Jesus, the son of Mary, clear proofs and supported him with the Pure Spirit [i.e., the angel Gabriel]. But is it [not] that every time a messenger came to you, [O Children of Israel], with what your souls did not desire, you were arrogant? And a party [of messengers] you denied and another party you killed.",
    "88": "And they said, \"Our hearts are wrapped.\" But, [in fact], All\u0101h has cursed them for their disbelief, so little is it that they believe.",
    "89": "And when there came to them a Book [i.e., the Qur\u2019\u0101n] from All\u0101h confirming that which was with them - although before they used to pray for victory against those who disbelieved - but [then] when there came to them that which they recognized, they disbelieved in it; so the curse of All\u0101h will be upon the disbelievers.",
    "90": "How wretched is that for which they sold themselves - that they would disbelieve in what All\u0101h has revealed through [their] outrage that All\u0101h would send down His favor upon whom He wills from among His servants. So they returned having [earned] wrath upon wrath. And for the disbelievers is a humiliating punishment.",
    "91": "And when it is said to them, \"Believe in what All\u0101h has revealed,\" they say, \"We believe [only] in what was revealed to us.\" And they disbelieve in what came after it, while it is the truth confirming that which is with them. Say, \"Then why did you kill the prophets of All\u0101h before, if you are [indeed] believers?\"",
    "92": "And Moses had certainly brought you clear proofs. Then you took the calf [in worship] after that, while you were wrongdoers.",
    "93": "And [recall] when We took your covenant and raised over you the mount, [saying], \"Take what We have given you with determination and listen.\" They said [instead], \"We hear and disobey.\" And their hearts absorbed [the worship of] the calf because of their disbelief. Say, \"How wretched is that which your faith enjoins upon you, if you should be believers.\"",
    "94": "Say, [O Mu\u1e25ammad], \"If the home of the Hereafter with All\u0101h is for you alone and not the [other] people, then wish for death, if you should be truthful.\"",
    "95": "But never will they wish for it, ever, because of what their hands have put forth. And All\u0101h is Knowing of the wrongdoers.",
    "96": "And you will surely find them the most greedy of people for life - [even] more than those who associate others with All\u0101h. One of them wishes that he could be granted life a thousand years, but it would not remove him in the least from the [coming] punishment that he should be granted life. And All\u0101h is Seeing of what they do.",
    "97": "Say, \"Whoever is an enemy to Gabriel - it is [none but] he who has brought it [i.e., the Qur\u2019\u0101n] down upon your heart, [O Mu\u1e25ammad], by permission of All\u0101h, confirming that which was before it and as guidance and good tidings for the believers.\"",
    "98": "Whoever is an enemy to All\u0101h and His angels and His messengers and Gabriel and Michael - then indeed, All\u0101h is an enemy to the disbelievers.",
    "99": "And We have certainly revealed to you verses [which are] clear proofs, and no one would deny them except the defiantly disobedient.",
    "100": "Is it not [true] that every time they took a covenant a party of them threw it away? But, [in fact], most of them do not believe.",
    "101": "And when a messenger from All\u0101h came to them confirming that which was with them, a party of those who had been given the Scripture threw the Scripture of All\u0101h [i.e., the Torah] behind their backs as if they did not know [what it contained].",
    "102": "And they followed [instead] what the devils had recited during the reign of Solomon. It was not Solomon who disbelieved, but the devils disbelieved, teaching people magic and that which was revealed to the two angels at Babylon, H\u0101r\u016bt and M\u0101r\u016bt. But they [i.e., the two angels] do not teach anyone unless they say, \"We are a trial, so do not disbelieve [by practicing magic].\" And [yet] they learn from them that by which they cause separation between a man and his wife. But they do not harm anyone through it except by permission of All\u0101h. And they [i.e., people] learn what harms them and does not benefit them. But they [i.e., the Children of Israel] certainly knew that whoever purchased it [i.e., magic] would not have in the Hereafter any share. And wretched is that for which they sold themselves, if they only knew.",
    "103": "And if they had believed and feared All\u0101h, then the reward from All\u0101h would have been [far] better, if they only knew.",
    "104": "O you who have believed, say not [to All\u0101h's Messenger], \"R\u0101\u02bfin\u0101\" but say, \"Un\u1e93urn\u0101\" and listen. And for the disbelievers is a painful punishment.",
    "105": "Neither those who disbelieve from the People of the Scripture [i.e., the Jews and Christians] nor the polytheists wish that any good should be sent down to you from your Lord. But All\u0101h selects for His mercy whom He wills, and All\u0101h is the possessor of great bounty.",
    "106": "We do not abrogate a verse or cause it to be forgotten except that We bring forth [one] better than it or similar to it. Do you not know that All\u0101h is over all things competent?",
    "107": "Do you not know that to All\u0101h belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth and [that] you have not besides All\u0101h any protector or any helper?",
    "108": "Or do you intend to ask your Messenger as Moses was asked before? And whoever exchanges faith for disbelief has certainly strayed from the soundness of the way.",
    "109": "Many of the People of the Scripture wish they could turn you back to disbelief after you have believed, out of envy from themselves [even] after the truth has become clear to them. So pardon and overlook until All\u0101h delivers His command. Indeed, All\u0101h is over all things competent.",
    "110": "And establish prayer and give zak\u0101h, and whatever good you put forward for yourselves - you will find it with All\u0101h. Indeed All\u0101h, of what you do, is Seeing.",
    "111": "And they say, \"None will enter Paradise except one who is a Jew or a Christian.\" That is [merely] their wishful thinking. Say, \"Produce your proof, if you should be truthful.\"",
    "112": "Yes, [on the contrary], whoever submits his face [i.e., self] in Isl\u0101m to All\u0101h while being a doer of good will have his reward with his Lord. And no fear will there be concerning them, nor will they grieve.",
    "113": "The Jews say, \"The Christians have nothing [true] to stand on,\" and the Christians say, \"The Jews have nothing to stand on,\" although they [both] recite the Scripture. Thus do those who know not [i.e., the polytheists] speak the same as their words. But All\u0101h will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection concerning that over which they used to differ.",
    "114": "And who are more unjust than those who prevent the name of All\u0101h from being mentioned [i.e., praised] in His mosques and strive toward their destruction. It is not for them to enter them except in fear. For them in this world is disgrace, and they will have in the Hereafter a great punishment.",
    "115": "And to All\u0101h belongs the east and the west. So wherever you [might] turn, there is the Face of All\u0101h. Indeed, All\u0101h is all-Encompassing and Knowing.",
    "116": "They say, \"All\u0101h has taken a son.\" Exalted is He! Rather, to Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and the earth. All are devoutly obedient to Him,",
    "117": "Originator of the heavens and the earth. When He decrees a matter, He only says to it, \"Be,\" and it is.",
    "118": "Those who do not know say, \"Why does All\u0101h not speak to us or there come to us a sign?\" Thus spoke those before them like their words. Their hearts resemble each other. We have shown clearly the signs to a people who are certain [in faith].",
    "119": "Indeed, We have sent you, [O Mu\u1e25ammad], with the truth as a bringer of good tidings and a warner, and you will not be asked about the companions of Hellfire.",
    "120": "And never will the Jews and the Christians approve of you until you follow their religion. Say, \"Indeed, the guidance of All\u0101h is the [only] guidance.\" If you were to follow their desires after what has come to you of knowledge, you would have against All\u0101h no protector or helper.",
    "121": "Those to whom We have given the Book recite it with its true recital. They [are the ones who] believe in it. And whoever disbelieves in it - it is they who are the losers.",

    "123": "And fear a Day when no soul will suffice for another soul at all, and no compensation will be accepted from it, nor will any intercession benefit it, nor will they be aided.",
    "124": "And [mention, O Mu\u1e25ammad], when Abraham was tried by his Lord with words [i.e., commands] and he fulfilled them. [All\u0101h] said, \"Indeed, I will make you a leader for the people.\" [Abraham] said, \"And of my descendants?\" [All\u0101h] said, \"My covenant does not include the wrongdoers.\"",
    "125": "And [mention] when We made the House [i.e., the Ka\u02bfbah] a place of return for the people and [a place of] security. And take, [O believers], from the standing place of Abraham a place of prayer. And We charged Abraham and Ishmael, [saying], \"Purify My House for those who perform \u1e6daw\u0101f and those who are staying [there] for worship and those who bow and prostrate [in prayer].\"",
    "126": "And [mention] when Abraham said, \"My Lord, make this a secure city and provide its people with fruits - whoever of them believes in All\u0101h and the Last Day.\" [All\u0101h] said, \"And whoever disbelieves - I will grant him enjoyment for a little; then I will force him to the punishment of the Fire, and wretched is the destination.\"",
    "127": "And [mention] when Abraham was raising the foundations of the House and [with him] Ishmael, [saying], \"Our Lord, accept [this] from us. Indeed, You are the Hearing, the Knowing.",
    "128": "Our Lord, and make us Muslims [in submission] to You and from our descendants a Muslim nation [in submission] to You. And show us our rites [of worship] and accept our repentance. Indeed, You are the Accepting of Repentance, the Merciful.",
    "129": "Our Lord, and send among them a messenger from themselves who will recite to them Your verses and teach them the Book and wisdom and purify them. Indeed, You are the Exalted in Might, the Wise.\"",
    "130": "And who would be averse to the religion of Abraham except one who makes a fool of himself. And We had chosen him in this world, and indeed he, in the Hereafter, will be among the righteous.",
    "131": "When his Lord said to him, \"Submit,\" he said, \"I have submitted [in Isl\u0101m] to the Lord of the worlds.\"",
    "132": "And Abraham instructed his sons [to do the same] and [so did] Jacob, [saying], \"O my sons, indeed All\u0101h has chosen for you this religion, so do not die except while you are Muslims.\"",
    "133": "Or were you witnesses when death approached Jacob, when he said to his sons, \"What will you worship after me?\" They said, \"We will worship your God and the God of your fathers, Abraham and Ishmael and Isaac - one God. And we are Muslims [in submission] to Him.\"",
    "134": "That was a nation which has passed on. It will have [the consequence of] what it earned, and you will have what you have earned. And you will not be asked about what they used to do.",
    "135": "They say, \"Be Jews or Christians [so] you will be guided.\" Say, \"Rather, [we follow] the religion of Abraham, inclining toward truth, and he was not of the polytheists.\"",
    "136": "Say, [O believers], \"We have believed in All\u0101h and what has been revealed to us and what has been revealed to Abraham and Ishmael and Isaac and Jacob and the Descendants [al-Asb\u0101\u1e6d] and what was given to Moses and Jesus and what was given to the prophets from their Lord. We make no distinction between any of them, and we are Muslims [in submission] to Him.\"",
    "137": "So if they believe in the same as you believe in, then they have been [rightly] guided; but if they turn away, they are only in dissension, and All\u0101h will be sufficient for you against them. And He is the Hearing, the Knowing.",

    "143": "And thus We have made you a median [i.e., just] community that you will be witnesses over the people and the Messenger will be a witness over you. And We did not make the qiblah which you used to face except that We might make evident who would follow the Messenger from who would turn back on his heels. And indeed, it is difficult except for those whom All\u0101h has guided. And never would All\u0101h have caused you to lose your faith [i.e., your previous prayers]. Indeed All\u0101h is, to the people, Kind and Merciful.",
    "144": "We have certainly seen the turning of your face, [O Mu\u1e25ammad], toward the heaven, and We will surely turn you to a qiblah with which you will be pleased. So turn your face [i.e., yourself] toward al-Masjid al-\u1e24ar\u0101m. And wherever you [believers] are, turn your faces [i.e., yourselves] toward it [in prayer]. Indeed, those who have been given the Scripture [i.e., the Jews and the Christians] well know that it is the truth from their Lord. And All\u0101h is not unaware of what they do.",
    "145": "And if you brought to those who were given the Scripture every sign, they would not follow your qiblah. Nor will you be a follower of their qiblah. Nor would they be followers of one another's qiblah. So if you were to follow their desires after what has come to you of knowledge, indeed, you would then be among the wrongdoers.",
    "146": "Those to whom We gave the Scripture know him [i.e., Prophet Mu\u1e25ammad (\ufdfa)] as they know their own sons. But indeed, a party of them conceal the truth while they know [it].",

    "148": "For each [religious following] is a [prayer] direction toward which it faces. So race to [all that is] good. Wherever you may be, All\u0101h will bring you forth [for judgement] all together. Indeed, All\u0101h is over all things competent.",
    "149": "So from wherever you go out [for prayer, O Mu\u1e25ammad], turn your face toward al-Masjid al-\u1e24ar\u0101m, and indeed, it is the truth from your Lord. And All\u0101h is not unaware of what you do.",
    "150": "And from wherever you go out [for prayer], turn your face toward al-Masjid al-\u1e24ar\u0101m. And wherever you [believers] may be, turn your faces toward it in order that the people will not have any argument against you, except for those of them who commit wrong; so fear them not but fear Me. And [it is] so I may complete My favor upon you and that you may be guided,",
    "151": "Just as We have sent among you a messenger from yourselves reciting to you Our verses and purifying you and teaching you the Book and wisdom and teaching you that which you did not know.",
    "152": "So remember Me; I will remember you. And be grateful to Me and do not deny Me.",

So whoever makes \u1e25ajj [pilgrimage] to the House or performs \u02bfumrah - there is no blame upon him for walking between them. And whoever volunteers good - then indeed, All\u0101h is Appreciative and Knowing.",
    "159": "Indeed, those who conceal what We sent down of clear proofs and guidance after We made it clear for the people in the Scripture - those are cursed by All\u0101h and cursed by those who curse,",
    "160": "Except for those who repent and correct themselves and make evident [what they concealed]. Those - I will accept their repentance, and I am the Accepting of Repentance, the Merciful.",
    "161": "Indeed, those who disbelieve and die while they are disbelievers - upon them will be the curse of All\u0101h and of the angels and the people, all together,",
    "162": "Abiding eternally therein. The punishment will not be lightened for them, nor will they be reprieved.",
    "163": "And your god is one God. There is no deity [worthy of worship] except Him, the Entirely Merciful, the Especially Merciful.",
    "164": "Indeed, in the creation of the heavens and the earth, and the alternation of the night and the day, and the [great] ships which sail through the sea with that which benefits people, and what All\u0101h has sent down from the heavens of rain, giving life thereby to the earth after its lifelessness and dispersing therein every [kind of] moving creature, and [His] directing of the winds and the clouds controlled between the heaven and earth are signs for a people who use reason.",
    "165": "And [yet], among the people are those who take other than All\u0101h as equals [to Him]. They love them as they [should] love All\u0101h. But those who believe are stronger in love for All\u0101h. And if only they who have wronged would consider [that] when they see the punishment, [they will be certain] that all power belongs to All\u0101h and that All\u0101h is severe in punishment.",
    "166": "[And they should consider that] when those who have been followed disassociate themselves from those who followed [them], and they [all] see the punishment, and cut off from them are the ties [of relationship],",
    "167": "Those who followed will say, \"If only we had another turn [at worldly life] so we could disassociate ourselves from them as they have disassociated themselves from us.\" Thus will All\u0101h show them their deeds as regrets upon them. And they are never to emerge from the Fire.",
    "168": "O mankind, eat from whatever is on earth [that is] lawful and good and do not follow the footsteps of Satan. Indeed, he is to you a clear enemy.",

    "173": "He has only forbidden to you dead animals, blood, the flesh of swine, and that which has been dedicated to other than All\u0101h. But whoever is forced [by necessity], neither desiring [it] nor transgressing [its limit], there is no sin upon him. Indeed, All\u0101h is Forgiving and Merciful.",
    "174": "Indeed, they who conceal what All\u0101h has sent down of the Book and exchange it for a small price - those consume not into their bellies except the Fire. And All\u0101h will not speak to them on the Day of Resurrection, nor will He purify them. And they will have a painful punishment.",
    "175": "Those are the ones who have exchanged guidance for error and forgiveness for punishment. How patient they are for [i.e., in pursuit of] the Fire!",
    "176": "That is [deserved by them] because All\u0101h has sent down the Book in truth. And indeed, those who differ over the Book are in extreme dissension.",
    "177": "Righteousness is not that you turn your faces toward the east or the west, but [true] righteousness is [in] one who believes in All\u0101h, the Last Day, the angels, the Book, and the prophets and gives wealth, in spite of love for it, to relatives, orphans, the needy, the traveler, those who ask [for help], and for freeing slaves; [and who] establishes prayer and gives zak\u0101h; [those who] fulfill their promise when they promise; and [those who] are patient in poverty and hardship and during battle. Those are the ones who have been true, and it is those who are the righteous.",
    "178": "O you who have believed, prescribed for you is legal retribution for those murdered - the free for the free, the slave for the slave, and the female for the female. But whoever overlooks from his brother [i.e., the killer] anything, then there should be a suitable follow-up and payment to him [i.e., the deceased's heir or legal representative] with good conduct. This is an alleviation from your Lord and a mercy. But whoever transgresses after that will have a painful punishment.",

    "184": "[Fasting for] a limited number of days. So whoever among you is ill or on a journey [during them] - then an equal number of other days [are to be made up]. And upon those who are able [to fast, but with hardship] - a ransom [as substitute] of feeding a poor person [each day]. And whoever volunteers good [i.e., excess] - it is better for him. But to fast is best for you, if you only knew.",
    "185": "The month of Rama\u1e0d\u0101n [is that] in which was revealed the Qur\u2019\u0101n, a guidance for the people and clear proofs of guidance and criterion. So whoever sights [the crescent of] the month, let him fast it; and whoever is ill or on a journey - then an equal number of other days. All\u0101h intends for you ease and does not intend for you hardship and [wants] for you to complete the period and to glorify All\u0101h for that [to] which He has guided you; and perhaps you will be grateful.",
    "186": "And when My servants ask you, [O Mu\u1e25ammad], concerning Me - indeed I am near. I respond to the invocation of the supplicant when he calls upon Me. So let them respond to Me [by obedience] and believe in Me that they may be [rightly] guided.",
    "187": "It has been made permissible for you the night preceding fasting to go to your wives [for sexual relations]. They are a clothing for you and you are a clothing for them. All\u0101h knows that you used to deceive yourselves, so He accepted your repentance and forgave you. So now, have relations with them and seek that which All\u0101h has decreed for you [i.e., offspring]. And eat and drink until the white thread of dawn becomes distinct to you from the black thread [of night]. Then complete the fast until the night [i.e., sunset]. And do not have relations with them as long as you are staying for worship in the mosques. These are the limits [set by] All\u0101h, so do not approach them. Thus does All\u0101h make clear His verses [i.e., ordinances] to the people that they may become righteous.",

Say, \"They are measurements of time for the people and for \u1e25ajj [pilgrimage].\" And it is not righteousness to enter houses from the back, but righteousness is [in] one who fears All\u0101h. And enter houses from their doors. And fear All\u0101h that you may succeed.",

    "193": "Fight them until there is no [more] fitnah and [until] religion [i.e., worship] is [acknowledged to be] for All\u0101h. But if they cease, then there is to be no aggression [i.e., assault] except against the oppressors.",

    "195": "And spend in the way of All\u0101h and do not throw [yourselves] with your [own] hands into destruction [by refraining]. And do good; indeed, All\u0101h loves the doers of good.",

And do not shave your heads until the sacrificial animal has reached its place of slaughter. And whoever among you is ill or has an ailment of the head [making shaving necessary must offer] a ransom of fasting [three days] or charity or sacrifice. And when you are secure, then whoever performs \u02bfumrah [during the \u1e25ajj months] followed by \u1e25ajj [offers] what can be obtained with ease of sacrificial animals. And whoever cannot find [or afford such an animal] - then a fast of three days during \u1e25ajj and of seven when you have returned [home]. Those are ten complete [days]. This is for those whose family is not in the area of al-Masjid al-\u1e24ar\u0101m. And fear All\u0101h and know that All\u0101h is severe in penalty.",

And whatever good you do - All\u0101h knows it. And take provisions, but indeed, the best provision is fear of All\u0101h. And fear Me, O you of understanding.",
    "198": "There is no blame upon you for seeking bounty from your Lord [during \u1e25ajj]. But when you depart from \u02bfAraf\u0101t, remember All\u0101h at al-Mash\u02bfar al-\u1e24ar\u0101m. And remember Him, as He has guided you, for indeed, you were before that among those astray.",

And let not the witnesses refuse when they are called upon. And do not be [too] weary to write it, whether it is small or large, for its [specified] term. That is more just in the sight of All\u0101h and stronger as evidence and more likely to prevent doubt between you, except when it is an immediate transaction which you conduct among yourselves. For [then] there is no blame upon you if you do not write it. And take witnesses when you conclude a contract. Let no scribe be harmed or any witness. For if you do so, indeed, it is [grave] disobedience in you. And fear All\u0101h. And All\u0101h teaches you. And All\u0101h is Knowing of all things.",

For it was said to them, \"Come, fight in the way of All\u0101h or [at least] defend.\" They said, \"If we had known [there would be] battle, we would have followed you.\" They were nearer to disbelief that day than to faith, saying with their mouths what was not in their hearts.

    "168": "Those who said about their brothers while sitting [at home], \"If they had obeyed us, they would not have been killed.\" Say, \"Then prevent death from yourselves, if you should be truthful.\"",

And wretched is that which they purchased.",

Those who disbelieve wish that you would neglect your weapons and your baggage so they could come down upon you in one [single] attack.

    "2": "O you who have believed, do not violate the rites of All\u0101h or [the sanctity of] the sacred month or [neglect the marking of] the sacrificial animals and garlanding [them] or [violate the safety of] those coming to the Sacred House seeking bounty from their Lord and [His] approval. But when you come out of i\u1e25r\u0101m, then [you may] hunt. And do not let the hatred of a people for having obstructed you from al-Masjid al-\u1e24ar\u0101m lead you to transgress. And cooperate in righteousness and piety, but do not cooperate in sin and aggression. And fear All\u0101h; indeed, All\u0101h is severe in penalty.",
    "3": "Prohibited to you are dead animals, blood, the flesh of swine, and that which has been dedicated to other than All\u0101h, and [those animals] killed by strangling or by a violent blow or by a head-long fall or by the goring of horns, and those from which a wild animal has eaten, except what you [are able to] slaughter [before its death], and those which are sacrificed on stone altars, and [prohibited is] that you seek decision through divining arrows. That is grave disobedience. This day those who disbelieve have despaired of [defeating] your religion; so fear them not, but fear Me. This day I have perfected for you your religion and completed My favor upon you and have approved for you Isl\u0101m as religion. But whoever is forced by severe hunger with no inclination to sin - then indeed, All\u0101h is Forgiving and Merciful.",
    "4": "They ask you, [O Mu\u1e25ammad], what has been made lawful for them. Say, \"Lawful for you are [all] good foods and [game caught by] what you have trained of hunting animals which you train as All\u0101h has taught you. So eat of what they catch for you, and mention the name of All\u0101h upon it, and fear All\u0101h.\" Indeed, All\u0101h is swift in account.",
    "5": "This day [all] good foods have been made lawful, and the food of those who were given the Scripture is lawful for you and your food is lawful for them. And [lawful in marriage are] chaste women from among the believers and chaste women from among those who were given the Scripture before you, when you have given them their due compensation, desiring chastity, not unlawful sexual intercourse or taking [secret] lovers. And whoever denies the faith - his work has become worthless, and he, in the Hereafter, will be among the losers.",
    "6": "O you who have believed, when you rise to [perform] prayer, wash your faces and your forearms to the elbows and wipe over your heads and wash your feet to the ankles. And if you are in a state of jan\u0101bah, then purify yourselves. But if you are ill or on a journey or one of you comes from the place of relieving himself or you have contacted women and do not find water, then seek clean earth and wipe over your faces and hands with it. All\u0101h does not intend to make difficulty for you, but He intends to purify you and complete His favor upon you that you may be grateful.",
    "7": "And remember the favor of All\u0101h upon you and His covenant with which He bound you when you said, \"We hear and we obey\"; and fear All\u0101h. Indeed, All\u0101h is Knowing of that within the breasts.",
    "8": "O you who have believed, be persistently standing firm for All\u0101h, witnesses in justice, and do not let the hatred of a people prevent you from being just. Be just; that is nearer to righteousness. And fear All\u0101h; indeed, All\u0101h is [fully] Aware of what you do.",
    "9": "All\u0101h has promised those who believe and do righteous deeds [that] for them there is forgiveness and great reward.",
    "10": "But those who disbelieve and deny Our signs - those are the companions of Hellfire.",
    "11": "O you who have believed, remember the favor of All\u0101h upon you when a people determined to extend their hands [in aggression] against you, but He withheld their hands from you; and fear All\u0101h. And upon All\u0101h let the believers rely.",
    "12": "And All\u0101h had already taken a covenant from the Children of Israel, and We delegated from among them twelve leaders. And All\u0101h said, \"I am with you. If you establish prayer and give zak\u0101h and believe in My messengers and support them and loan All\u0101h a goodly loan, I will surely remove from you your misdeeds and admit you to gardens beneath which rivers flow. But whoever of you disbelieves after that has certainly strayed from the soundness of the way.\"",
    "13": "So for their breaking of the covenant We cursed them and made their hearts hardened. They distort words from their [proper] places [i.e., usages] and have forgotten a portion of that of which they were reminded. And you will still observe deceit among them, except a few of them. But pardon them and overlook [their misdeeds]. Indeed, All\u0101h loves the doers of good.",
    "14": "And from those who say, \"We are Christians\" We took their covenant; but they forgot a portion of that of which they were reminded. So We caused among them animosity and hatred until the Day of Resurrection. And All\u0101h is going to inform them about what they used to do.",
    "15": "O People of the Scripture, there has come to you Our Messenger making clear to you much of what you used to conceal of the Scripture and overlooking much. There has come to you from All\u0101h a light and a clear Book [i.e., the Qur\u2019\u0101n]",
    "16": "By which All\u0101h guides those who pursue His pleasure to the ways of peace and brings them out from darknesses into the light, by His permission, and guides them to a straight path.",
    "17": "They have certainly disbelieved who say that All\u0101h is Christ, the son of Mary. Say, \"Then who could prevent All\u0101h at all if He had intended to destroy Christ, the son of Mary, or his mother or everyone on the earth?\" And to All\u0101h belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth and whatever is between them. He creates what He wills, and All\u0101h is over all things competent.",
    "18": "But the Jews and the Christians say, \"We are the children of All\u0101h and His beloved.\" Say, \"Then why does He punish you for your sins?\" Rather, you are human beings from among those He has created. He forgives whom He wills, and He punishes whom He wills. And to All\u0101h belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth and whatever is between them, and to Him is the [final] destination.",
    "19": "O People of the Scripture, there has come to you Our Messenger to make clear to you [the religion] after a period [of suspension] of messengers, lest you say, \"There came not to us any bringer of good tidings or a warner.\" But there has come to you a bringer of good tidings and a warner. And All\u0101h is over all things competent.",
    "20": "And [mention, O Mu\u1e25ammad], when Moses said to his people, \"O my people, remember the favor of All\u0101h upon you when He appointed among you prophets and made you possessors and gave you that which He had not given anyone among the worlds.",
    "21": "O my people, enter the blessed land [i.e., Palestine] which All\u0101h has assigned to you and do not turn back [from fighting in All\u0101h's cause] and [thus] become losers.\"",
    "22": "They said, \"O Moses, indeed within it is a people of tyrannical strength, and indeed, we will never enter it until they leave it; but if they leave it, then we will enter.\"",
    "23": "Said two men from those who feared [to disobey] upon whom All\u0101h had bestowed favor, \"Enter upon them through the gate, for when you have entered it, you will be predominant. And upon All\u0101h rely, if you should be believers.\"",
    "24": "They said, \"O Moses, indeed we will not enter it, ever, as long as they are within it; so go, you and your Lord, and fight. Indeed, we are remaining right here.\"",
    "25": "[Moses] said, \"My Lord, indeed I do not possess [i.e., control] except myself and my brother, so part us from the defiantly disobedient people.\"",
    "26": "[All\u0101h] said, \"Then indeed, it is forbidden to them for forty years [in which] they will wander throughout the land. So do not grieve over the defiantly disobedient people.\"",
    "27": "And recite to them the story of Adam's two sons, in truth, when they both made an offering [to All\u0101h], and it was accepted from one of them but was not accepted from the other. Said [the latter], \"I will surely kill you.\" Said [the former], \"Indeed, All\u0101h only accepts from the righteous [who fear Him].",
    "28": "If you should raise your hand toward me to kill me - I shall not raise my hand toward you to kill you. Indeed, I fear All\u0101h, Lord of the worlds.",
    "29": "Indeed, I want you to obtain [thereby] my sin and your sin so you will be among the companions of the Fire. And that is the recompense of wrongdoers.\"",
    "30": "And his soul permitted to him the murder of his brother, so he killed him and became among the losers.",
    "31": "Then All\u0101h sent a crow searching [i.e., scratching] in the ground to show him how to hide the disgrace of his brother. He said, \"O woe to me! Have I failed to be like this crow and hide the disgrace [i.e., body] of my brother?\" And he became of the regretful.",
    "32": "Because of that, We decreed upon the Children of Israel that whoever kills a soul unless for a soul or for corruption [done] in the land - it is as if he had slain mankind entirely. And whoever saves one - it is as if he had saved mankind entirely. And Our messengers had certainly come to them with clear proofs. Then indeed many of them, [even] after that, throughout the land, were transgressors.",
    "33": "Indeed, the penalty for those who wage war against All\u0101h and His Messenger and strive upon earth [to cause] corruption is none but that they be killed or crucified or that their hands and feet be cut off from opposite sides or that they be exiled from the land. That is for them a disgrace in this world; and for them in the Hereafter is a great punishment,",
    "34": "Except for those who return [repenting] before you overcome [i.e., apprehend] them. And know that All\u0101h is Forgiving and Merciful.",
    "35": "O you who have believed, fear All\u0101h and seek the means [of nearness] to Him and strive in His cause that you may succeed.",
    "36": "Indeed, those who disbelieve - if they should have all that is in the earth and the like of it with it by which to ransom themselves from the punishment of the Day of Resurrection, it will not be accepted from them, and for them is a painful punishment.",
    "37": "They will wish to get out of the Fire, but never are they to emerge therefrom, and for them is an enduring punishment.",
    "38": "[As for] the thief, the male and the female, amputate their hands in recompense for what they earned [i.e., committed] as a deterrent [punishment] from All\u0101h. And All\u0101h is Exalted in Might and Wise.",
    "39": "But whoever repents after his wrongdoing and reforms, indeed, All\u0101h will turn to him in forgiveness. Indeed, All\u0101h is Forgiving and Merciful.",
    "40": "Do you not know that to All\u0101h belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth? He punishes whom He wills and forgives whom He wills, and All\u0101h is over all things competent.",
    "41": "O Messenger, let them not grieve you who hasten into disbelief of those who say, \"We believe\" with their mouths, but their hearts believe not, and from among the Jews. [They are] avid listeners to falsehood, listening to another people who have not come to you. They distort words beyond their [proper] places [i.e., usages], saying, \"If you are given this, take it; but if you are not given it, then beware.\" But he for whom All\u0101h intends fitnah - never will you possess [power to do] for him a thing against All\u0101h. Those are the ones for whom All\u0101h does not intend to purify their hearts. For them in this world is disgrace, and for them in the Hereafter is a great punishment.",
    "42": "[They are] avid listeners to falsehood, devourers of [what is] unlawful. So if they come to you, [O Mu\u1e25ammad], judge between them or turn away from them. And if you turn away from them - never will they harm you at all. And if you judge, judge between them with justice. Indeed, All\u0101h loves those who act justly.",
    "43": "But how is it that they come to you for judgement while they have the Torah, in which is the judgement of All\u0101h? Then they turn away, [even] after that; but those are not [in fact] believers.",
    "44": "Indeed, We sent down the Torah, in which was guidance and light. The prophets who submitted [to All\u0101h] judged by it for the Jews, as did the rabbis and scholars by that with which they were entrusted of the Scripture of All\u0101h, and they were witnesses thereto. So do not fear the people but fear Me, and do not exchange My verses for a small price [i.e., worldly gain]. And whoever does not judge by what All\u0101h has revealed - then it is those who are the disbelievers.",
    "45": "And We ordained for them therein a life for a life, an eye for an eye, a nose for a nose, an ear for an ear, a tooth for a tooth, and for wounds is legal retribution. But whoever gives [up his right as] charity, it is an expiation for him. And whoever does not judge by what All\u0101h has revealed - then it is those who are the wrongdoers [i.e., the unjust].",
    "46": "And We sent, following in their footsteps, Jesus, the son of Mary, confirming that which came before him in the Torah; and We gave him the Gospel, in which was guidance and light and confirming that which preceded it of the Torah as guidance and instruction for the righteous.",
    "47": "And let the People of the Gospel judge by what All\u0101h has revealed therein. And whoever does not judge by what All\u0101h has revealed - then it is those who are the defiantly disobedient.",
    "48": "And We have revealed to you, [O Mu\u1e25ammad], the Book [i.e., the Qur\u2019\u0101n] in truth, confirming that which preceded it of the Scripture and as a criterion over it. So judge between them by what All\u0101h has revealed and do not follow their inclinations away from what has come to you of the truth. To each of you We prescribed a law and a method. Had All\u0101h willed, He would have made you one nation [united in religion], but [He intended] to test you in what He has given you; so race to [all that is] good. To All\u0101h is your return all together, and He will [then] inform you concerning that over which you used to differ.",
    "49": "And judge, [O Mu\u1e25ammad], between them by what All\u0101h has revealed and do not follow their inclinations and beware of them, lest they tempt you away from some of what All\u0101h has revealed to you. And if they turn away - then know that All\u0101h only intends to afflict them with some of their [own] sins. And indeed, many among the people are defiantly disobedient.",
    "50": "Then is it the judgement of [the time of] ignorance they desire? But who is better than All\u0101h in judgement for a people who are certain [in faith].",
    "51": "O you who have believed, do not take the Jews and the Christians as allies. They are [in fact] allies of one another. And whoever is an ally to them among you - then indeed, he is [one] of them. Indeed, All\u0101h guides not the wrongdoing people.",
    "52": "So you see those in whose hearts is disease [i.e., hypocrisy] hastening into [association with] them, saying, \"We are afraid a misfortune may strike us.\" But perhaps All\u0101h will bring conquest or a decision from Him, and they will become, over what they have been concealing within themselves, regretful.",
    "53": "And those who believe will say, \"Are these the ones who swore by All\u0101h their strongest oaths that indeed they were with you?\" Their deeds have become worthless, and they have become losers.",
    "54": "O you who have believed, whoever of you should revert from his religion - All\u0101h will bring forth [in place of them] a people He will love and who will love Him [who are] humble toward the believers, strong against the disbelievers; they strive in the cause of All\u0101h and do not fear the blame of a critic. That is the favor of All\u0101h; He bestows it upon whom He wills. And All\u0101h is all-Encompassing and Knowing.",
    "55": "Your ally is none but All\u0101h and [therefore] His Messenger and those who have believed - those who establish prayer and give zak\u0101h, and they bow [in worship].",
    "56": "And whoever is an ally of All\u0101h and His Messenger and those who have believed - indeed, the party of All\u0101h - they will be the predominant.",
    "57": "O you who have believed, take not those who have taken your religion in ridicule and amusement among the ones who were given the Scripture before you nor the disbelievers as allies. And fear All\u0101h, if you should [truly] be believers.",
    "58": "And when you call to prayer, they take it in ridicule and amusement. That is because they are a people who do not use reason.",
    "59": "Say, \"O People of the Scripture, do you resent us except [for the fact] that we have believed in All\u0101h and what was revealed to us and what was revealed before and because most of you are defiantly disobedient?\"",
    "60": "Say, \"Shall I inform you of [what is] worse than that as penalty from All\u0101h? [It is that of] those whom All\u0101h has cursed and with whom He became angry and made of them apes and pigs and slaves of \u1e6d\u0101gh\u016bt. Those are worse in position and further astray from the sound way.\"",
    "61": "And when they come to you, they say, \"We believe.\" But they have entered with disbelief [in their hearts], and they have certainly left with it. And All\u0101h is most knowing of what they were concealing.",
    "62": "And you see many of them hastening into sin and aggression and the devouring of [what is] unlawful. How wretched is what they have been doing.",
    "63": "Why do the rabbis and religious scholars not forbid them from saying what is sinful and devouring what is unlawful? How wretched is what they have been practicing.",
    "64": "And the Jews say, \"The hand of All\u0101h is chained.\" Chained are their hands, and cursed are they for what they say. Rather, both His hands are extended; He spends however He wills. And that which has been revealed to you from your Lord will surely increase many of them in transgression and disbelief. And We have cast among them animosity and hatred until the Day of Resurrection. Every time they kindled the fire of war [against you], All\u0101h extinguished it. And they strive throughout the land [causing] corruption, and All\u0101h does not like corrupters.",
    "65": "And if only the People of the Scripture had believed and feared All\u0101h, We would have removed from them their misdeeds and admitted them to Gardens of Pleasure.",
    "66": "And if only they had upheld [the law of] the Torah, the Gospel, and what has been revealed to them from their Lord [i.e., the Qur\u2019\u0101n], they would have consumed [provision] from above them and from beneath their feet. Among them are a moderate [i.e., acceptable] community, but many of them - evil is that which they do.",
    "67": "O Messenger, announce that which has been revealed to you from your Lord, and if you do not, then you have not conveyed His message. And All\u0101h will protect you from the people. Indeed, All\u0101h does not guide the disbelieving people.",
    "68": "Say, \"O People of the Scripture, you are [standing] on nothing until you uphold [the law of] the Torah, the Gospel, and what has been revealed to you from your Lord [i.e., the Qur\u2019\u0101n].\" And that which has been revealed to you from your Lord will surely increase many of them in transgression and disbelief. So do not grieve over the disbelieving people.",
    "69": "Indeed, those who have believed [in Prophet Mu\u1e25ammad (\ufdfa)] and those [before him (\ufdfa)] who were Jews or Sabeans or Christians - those [among them] who believed in All\u0101h and the Last Day and did righteousness - no fear will there be concerning them, nor will they grieve.",
    "70": "We had already taken the covenant of the Children of Israel and had sent to them messengers. Whenever there came to them a messenger with what their souls did not desire, a party [of messengers] they denied, and another party they killed.",
    "71": "And they thought there would be no [resulting] punishment, so they became blind and deaf. Then All\u0101h turned to them in forgiveness; then [again] many of them became blind and deaf. And All\u0101h is Seeing of what they do.",
    "72": "They have certainly disbelieved who say, \"All\u0101h is the Messiah, the son of Mary\" while the Messiah has said, \"O Children of Israel, worship All\u0101h, my Lord and your Lord.\" Indeed, he who associates others with All\u0101h - All\u0101h has forbidden him Paradise, and his refuge is the Fire. And there are not for the wrongdoers any helpers.",
    "73": "They have certainly disbelieved who say, \"All\u0101h is the third of three.\" And there is no god except one God. And if they do not desist from what they are saying, there will surely afflict the disbelievers among them a painful punishment.",
    "74": "So will they not repent to All\u0101h and seek His forgiveness? And All\u0101h is Forgiving and Merciful.",
    "75": "The Messiah, son of Mary, was not but a messenger; [other] messengers have passed on before him. And his mother was a supporter of truth. They both used to eat food. Look how We make clear to them the signs; then look how they are deluded.",
    "76": "Say, \"Do you worship besides All\u0101h that which holds for you no [power of] harm or benefit while it is All\u0101h who is the Hearing, the Knowing?\"",
    "77": "Say, \"O People of the Scripture, do not exceed limits in your religion beyond the truth and do not follow the inclinations of a people who had gone astray before and misled many and have strayed from the soundness of the way.\"",
    "78": "Cursed were those who disbelieved among the Children of Israel by the tongue of David and of Jesus, the son of Mary. That was because they disobeyed and [habitually] transgressed.",
    "79": "They used not to prevent one another from wrongdoing that they did. How wretched was that which they were doing.",
    "80": "You see many of them becoming allies of those who disbelieved [i.e., the polytheists]. How wretched is that which they have put forth for themselves in that All\u0101h has become angry with them, and in the punishment they will abide eternally.",
    "81": "And if they had believed in All\u0101h and the Prophet and in what was revealed to him, they would not have taken them as allies; but many of them are defiantly disobedient.",
    "82": "You will surely find the most intense of the people in animosity toward the believers [to be] the Jews and those who associate others with All\u0101h; and you will find the nearest of them in affection to the believers those who say, \"We are Christians.\" That is because among them are priests and monks and because they are not arrogant.",
    "83": "And when they hear what has been revealed to the Messenger, you see their eyes overflowing with tears because of what they have recognized of the truth. They say, \"Our Lord, we have believed, so register us among the witnesses.",
    "84": "And why should we not believe in All\u0101h and what has come to us of the truth? And we aspire that our Lord will admit us [to Paradise] with the righteous people.\"",
    "85": "So All\u0101h rewarded them for what they said with gardens [in Paradise] beneath which rivers flow, wherein they abide eternally. And that is the reward of doers of good.",
    "86": "But those who disbelieved and denied Our signs - they are the companions of Hellfire.",
    "87": "O you who have believed, do not prohibit the good things which All\u0101h has made lawful to you and do not transgress. Indeed, All\u0101h does not like transgressors.",
    "88": "And eat of what All\u0101h has provided for you [which is] lawful and good. And fear All\u0101h, in whom you are believers.",
    "89": "All\u0101h will not impose blame upon you for what is meaningless in your oaths, but He will impose blame upon you for [breaking] what you intended of oaths. So its expiation is the feeding of ten needy people from the average of that which you feed your [own] families or clothing them or the freeing of a slave. But whoever cannot find [or afford it] - then a fast of three days [is required]. That is the expiation for oaths when you have sworn. But guard your oaths. Thus does All\u0101h make clear to you His verses [i.e., revealed law] that you may be grateful.",
    "90": "O you who have believed, indeed, intoxicants, gambling, [sacrificing on] stone alters [to other than All\u0101h], and divining arrows are but defilement from the work of Satan, so avoid it that you may be successful.",
    "91": "Satan only wants to cause between you animosity and hatred through intoxicants and gambling and to avert you from the remembrance of All\u0101h and from prayer. So will you not desist?",
    "92": "And obey All\u0101h and obey the Messenger and beware. And if you turn away - then know that upon Our Messenger is only [the responsibility for] clear notification.",
    "93": "There is not upon those who believe and do righteousness [any] blame concerning what they have eaten [in the past] if they [now] fear All\u0101h and believe and do righteous deeds, and then fear All\u0101h and believe, and then fear All\u0101h and do good; and All\u0101h loves the doers of good.",
    "94": "O you who have believed, All\u0101h will surely test you through something of the game that your hands and spears [can] reach, that All\u0101h may make evident those who fear Him unseen. And whoever transgresses after that - for him is a painful punishment.",
    "95": "O you who have believed, do not kill game while you are in the state of i\u1e25r\u0101m. And whoever of you kills it intentionally - the penalty is an equivalent from sacrificial animals to what he killed, as judged by two just men among you as an offering [to All\u0101h] delivered to the Ka\u02bfbah, or an expiation: the feeding of needy people or the equivalent of that in fasting, that he may taste the consequence of his matter [i.e., deed]. All\u0101h has pardoned what is past; but whoever returns [to violation], then All\u0101h will take retribution from him. And All\u0101h is Exalted in Might and Owner of Retribution.",
    "96": "Lawful to you is game from the sea and its food as provision for you and the travelers, but forbidden to you is game from the land as long as you are in the state of i\u1e25r\u0101m. And fear All\u0101h to whom you will be gathered.",
    "97": "All\u0101h has made the Ka\u02bfbah, the Sacred House, standing for the people and [has sanctified] the sacred months and the sacrificial animals and the garlands [by which they are identified]. That is so you may know that All\u0101h knows what is in the heavens and what is in the earth and that All\u0101h is Knowing of all things.",
    "98": "Know that All\u0101h is severe in penalty and that All\u0101h is Forgiving and Merciful.",
    "99": "Not upon the Messenger is [responsibility] except [for] notification. And All\u0101h knows whatever you reveal and whatever you conceal.",
    "100": "Say, \"Not equal are the evil and the good, although the abundance of evil might impress you.\" So fear All\u0101h, O you of understanding, that you may be successful.",
    "101": "O you who have believed, do not ask about things which, if they are shown to you, will distress you.

    "120": "And leave [i.e., desist from] what is apparent of sin and what is concealed thereof. Indeed, those who earn [blame for] sin will be recompensed for that which they used to commit.",
    "121": "And do not eat of that upon which the name of All\u0101h has not been mentioned, for indeed, it is grave disobedience. And indeed do the devils inspire their allies [among men] to dispute with you. And if you were to obey them, indeed, you would be associators [of others with Him].",
    "122": "And is one who was dead and We gave him life and made for him light by which to walk among the people like one who is in darkness, never to emerge therefrom? Thus it has been made pleasing to the disbelievers that which they were doing.",
    "123": "And thus We have placed within every city the greatest of its criminals to conspire therein. But they conspire not except against themselves, and they perceive [it] not.",
    "124": "And when a sign comes to them, they say, \"Never will we believe until we are given like that which was given to the messengers of All\u0101h.\" All\u0101h is most knowing of where [i.e., with whom] He places His message. There will afflict those who committed crimes debasement before All\u0101h and severe punishment for what they used to conspire.",
    "125": "So whoever All\u0101h wants to guide - He expands his breast to [contain] Isl\u0101m; and whoever He wants to send astray - He makes his breast tight and constricted as though he were climbing into the sky. Thus does All\u0101h place defilement upon those who do not believe.",

    "138": "And they say, \"These animals and crops are forbidden; no one may eat from them except whom we will,\" by their claim. And there are those [camels] whose backs are forbidden [by them] and those upon which the name of All\u0101h is not mentioned - [all of this] an invention of untruth about Him. He will punish them for what they were inventing.",
    "139": "And they say, \"What is in the bellies of these animals is exclusively for our males and forbidden to our females. But if it is [born] dead, then all of them have shares therein.\" He will punish them for their description. Indeed, He is Wise and Knowing.",
    "140": "They will have lost who killed their children in foolishness without knowledge and prohibited what All\u0101h had provided for them, inventing untruth about All\u0101h. They have gone astray and were not [rightly] guided.",

Eat of [each of] its fruit when it yields and give its due [zak\u0101h] on the day of its harvest. And be not excessive. Indeed, He does not like those who commit excess.",
    "142": "And of the grazing livestock are carriers [of burdens] and those [too] small. Eat of what All\u0101h has provided for you and do not follow the footsteps of Satan. Indeed, he is to you a clear enemy.",
    "143": "[They are] eight mates - of the sheep, two and of the goats, two. Say, \"Is it the two males He has forbidden or the two females or that which the wombs of the two females contain? Inform me with knowledge, if you should be truthful.\"",
    "144": "And of the camels, two and of the cattle, two. Say, \"Is it the two males He has forbidden or the two females or that which the wombs of the two females contain? Or were you witnesses when All\u0101h charged you with this? Then who is more unjust than one who invents a lie about All\u0101h to mislead the people by [something] other than knowledge? Indeed, All\u0101h does not guide the wrongdoing people.\"",
    "145": "Say, \"I do not find within that which was revealed to me [anything] forbidden to one who would eat it unless it be a dead animal or blood spilled out or the flesh of swine - for indeed, it is impure - or it be [that slaughtered in] disobedience, dedicated to other than All\u0101h. But whoever is forced [by necessity], neither desiring [it] nor transgressing [its limit], then indeed, your Lord is Forgiving and Merciful.\"",
    "146": "And to those who are Jews We prohibited every animal of uncloven hoof; and of the cattle and the sheep We prohibited to them their fat, except what adheres to their backs or the entrails or what is joined with bone.

    "151": "Say, \"Come, I will recite what your Lord has prohibited to you. [He commands] that you not associate anything with Him, and to parents, good treatment, and do not kill your children out of poverty; We will provide for you and them. And do not approach immoralities - what is apparent of them and what is concealed. And do not kill the soul which All\u0101h has forbidden [to be killed] except by [legal] right.

This has He instructed you that you may remember.",
    "153": "And, [moreover], this is My path, which is straight, so follow it; and do not follow [other] ways, for you will be separated from His way. This has He instructed you that you may become righteous.",
    "154": "Then We gave Moses the Scripture, making complete [Our favor] upon the one who did good [i.e., Moses] and as a detailed explanation of all things and as guidance and mercy that perhaps in the meeting with their Lord they would believe.",

The Day that some of the signs of your Lord will come no soul will benefit from its faith as long as it had not believed before or had earned through its faith some good. Say, \"Wait. Indeed, we [also] are waiting.\"",
    "159": "Indeed, those who have divided their religion and become sects - you, [O Mu\u1e25ammad], are not [associated] with them in anything. Their affair is only [left] to All\u0101h; then He will inform them about what they used to do.",
    "160": "Whoever comes [on the Day of Judgement] with a good deed will have ten times the like thereof [to his credit], and whoever comes with an evil deed will not be recompensed except the like thereof; and they will not be wronged.",
